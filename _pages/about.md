#### About Me

I am a final-year PhD Candidate at the University of Liverpool, as part of the [CDT in Data Analytics & Society](https://datacdt.org/). My supervisors are [Prof. Katie Atkinson](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/people/katie-marie-atkinson) from Computer Science and [Mr. Jeremy Marshall](https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/people/jeremy-marshall) from Law. My research is currently focused on augmenting Generative AI with domain knowledge for assisting legal decision-making within the European Court of Human Rights and European Patent Office.

Previously, I completed a MSc in Data Science & AI in 2021, and an integrated MSc in Data Analytics & Society in 2023 as part of my PhD training, both at the University of Liverpool.
